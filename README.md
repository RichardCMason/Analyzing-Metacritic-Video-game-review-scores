# Analyzing-Metacritic-Video-game-review-scores
### Problem Statement
The goal of this project was to analyze the aggregate review site, metacritic.com. <https://www.metacritic.com/>.  As someone whos always been interested in video games, I thought it would be interesting to see how game review scores had varied over time, and if there was any difference between "Critic Scores," and "User Scores".  

Critic Scores are scores given by professional video game journalist and review sites, and a combination of critic scores (proprietary formula) is the overall score reported by metacritic.  However, the site also allows users with an account to also leave a review.  So a combined "user score" is also reported.  

### Process
The first step in this project was to scrap the metacritic website to acquire their database of review scores.  After building a scraper and several hours later, and after appropriate data cleaning, my dataframe looked like this:
