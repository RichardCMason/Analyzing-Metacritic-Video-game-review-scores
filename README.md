EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In this project I scraped the aggregate review site Metacritic.com for video game reviews.  I obtained the following data for every game on the metacritic website:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
I also obtained the text of both "critic reviews" and "user reviews." Before we go on, though, A brief overview on how metacritic works:
OVERVIEW

The purpose of this is to identify any long-term trends in video game review stats, looking specifically at whether or not and how much things such as developer, platform, genre, user score, and the text of critic and user reviews influence the aggregate score.  NOTE: metacritic keeps it's particular algorithm confidential, and what we are doing here is not an attempt to divine that scoring methodology.  

RESULTS
1.)Game reviews- especially user reviews- have only gotten worse with time.  Is this because games have actually gotten worse or some intervening factor?
2.) State results from time series analysis
3.) results from nlp analysis
4.) use word2vec
5.) use random forest
6.) give most explanatory variables- what do we expect them to be?
7.)
